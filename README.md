# AtlasGUI for YT-DLP (YouTube video downloader).
A simple, but hopefully soon also feature rich, GUI for YT-DLP.

Distros are on the [homepage](http://www.youtubetransfer.com) only for now due to license thingies I need to go through.

A complete n00b learning VB by making this atrocious looking thing that is surprisingly simple and handy.

Currently has resolution choice, multibar URL input with click to paste from clipboard, support playlists, save default folder and resolution, select audio only, reset inputs, version checking and self-updater with no need for manually downloading updates or installing.

Needs [YT-DLP](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases) (it will be updated automatically, only need to download once) and [FFMPEG](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/#git-master-builds)

I hate arrays. So I refuse to use them when possible. Which is always.
