# AtlasGUI for YT-DLP
A simple, but hopefully soon also future rich, GUI for YT-DLP.

Distros are on the [homepage](http://www.youtubetransfer.com)

Currently has resolution choice, multibar URL input with click to paste from clipboard, support playlists, save default folder and resolution, select audio only, reset inputs, version checking and self-updater with no need for manually download updates or installing.

A complete n00b learning VB by making this atrocious looking thing that is surprisingly simple and handy.

I hate arrays. So I refuse to use them when possible. Which is always.

[Homepage with the sketchiest domainname that is 100% safe, but it was cheap.](http://www.youtubetransfer.com)
